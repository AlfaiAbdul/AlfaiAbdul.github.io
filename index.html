        <h2 class="sub">Pitch</h2>
        <p class="parag"> When working in Retail, financial analysis reports are rarely delivered to the sales manages as they are supposed to focus on leading and supervising their teams, but yet they are held accountable to driving sales.
            The power of analyzing numbers in such a position is underrated due to the a number of reasons such as the educational background of the manager.
            I personally, come from a financial background and was able to apply some analysis techniques (along with leadership and supervision skills) that helped me to turn negatives to positives across my departments.
            With that being said, now i am about to graduate from Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp in which i have learned how to find any kind of data i am looking for.
            I learned how to analyze and manipulate data using languages such as python to write and present detailed reports  and to use it to predict the future through series of codes.
